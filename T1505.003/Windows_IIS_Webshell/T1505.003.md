# T1505.003 - ASP/ASPX Web Shell

## Description

Based on explaination on Stackify, process `w3wp.exe` handles web request to the IIS web server. Attacker may upload asp/aspx web shell into the server and execute it by visiting the site that contains the web shell file.

### Execution of ASP/ASPX File

When user visits the asp/aspx file in IIS server, the `w3wp.exe` will compile the asp/aspx file into a DLL file and execute it.

![app_web_module_load.PNG](./Image_T1505.003/app_web_module_load.PNG)

It will loads into .net assemblies as well.

![dotnet_module_w3wp.PNG](./Image_T1505.003/dotnet_module_w3wp.PNG)

The artifact will left in the dotnet temp folder `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\<VERSION_NUM>\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root\[A-Za-z0-9]{8}\[A-Za-z0-9]{8}`

The folder might changed based on the version of dotnet used.

The `.compiled` file will points to the DLL file that contains the asp/aspx web code.

You may set the privilege level in IIS Manager

### Default Physical Path

The default phyiscal path is `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot`

![default_phy_path.PNG](./Image_T1505.003/default_phy_path.PNG)

### Default Log Setting

By default, `log file only` is selected. User can enable both log file and ETW event and refer to ETW event since ETW reads from the raw log file.

## Hunt

### Anomaly child process

Here are the list of the processes that the threat actor may spawn through `w3wp.exe`

```cmd
cmd.exe, powershell.exe, cscript.exe, wscript.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, ping.exe, whoami.exe
```

It is quite common to have `cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe` process spawned under `w3wp.exe`, have to baseline it based on your environment.

### Writing asp web shell into rootpath

Any suspicious asp/aspx files has been wrote recently in `%SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot`.

It needs to pivot with other telemetry such as file write/network events or baseline those files inside the `wwwroot` folder.

However the rootpath might different for each case, For example, ProxyShell exploit drop its web shell in `%ExchangeInstallPath%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\`

### Write Access from w3wp.exe

It has limited write access to any windows folder when threat actor wants to upload their files with default IIS privilege which includes:

- the main drive folder (e.g. c:\\) and then create file within that folder.
- Some of the folder in `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%`, `C:\ProgramData` in Windows 10, e.g. [USOShared](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/anyone-know-whats-usoprivate-usoshared-is.2782860/)

> When user request any file from the IIS web server. There will have a file creation event on that. (e.g. When user access on shell.asp, File event will be trigger on shell.asp)

### Network (HTTP)

Check the data being receive from the attacker and vice versa.

The format might be different based on the `Content-Type` they used

![http_protocol.PNG](./Image_T1505.003/http_protocol.PNG)

If https protocol used, those data will get encrypted which makes the hunting work harder.

![http_data.PNG](./Image_T1505.003/http_data.PNG)

### Logs

These IIS logs contains information on the file that has been access by users, user-agent, source/destination IP, request method, request status etc.

These information can access from both raw log file or ETW logs with Event ID `6200` in IIS-Loggin Logs.
