## Hunt

- For .dll library, file name might be change  
- Identify unsual windows binaries that loads these dlls  
- Identify any bulk File Events on those file extension mentioned in [T1560.001](https://github.com/ghoulgy/MITRE_Notes/blob/master/T1560.001/T1560_001_Archive_Collected_Data_Archive_via_Utility.md#possible-extention-to-be-compress-and-exfiltrate-not-limited-to-these) or sensitive keyword based on your company business  
- There are various type of libraries that can be loaded corresponding to the programming language used (e.g. Python, C++) and the OS env used (e.g. Windows, Unix), at least for custom malware  
- File size might be a good indicator as well if there are large amount of file being read by the process and user under certain period of time
